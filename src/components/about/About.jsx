        <p>Hello! </p>
        <p>My name is Mishran Haque. </p>
        <p>I am an Aerospace Engineering student at Ryerson University. Space and everything extraterrestrial was fascinating to me from early childhood and throughout my High School years. This interest soon evolved into the unavoidable career choice towards Science & Engineering. </p>
        <p>My passion for space travel and state-of-the-art vehicles eventually lead me to join the Aerospace Engineering Program at Ryerson University. Over my three years of university, I got to take various courses that strengthened my knowledge of aerospace applications. I got the opportunity to work with Ryerson Rocketry Club and experience the process behind designing and building a supersonic rocket. Furthermore, I also worked on various projects throughout my years, which involved researching and designing gliders and programming robots that perform various tasks. </p>
